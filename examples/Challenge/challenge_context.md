# Colloids: How low can we go?

The Royall Group is interested in using nano-colloidal systems to address the glass transition
which is arguably the greatest outstanding challenge in the basic physics of everyday materials. 
Colloids mimic atoms and molecules and thus exhibit the same behavior, such as forming (colloidal) glasses.
However, since they are micron-sized, they can be imaged with **3d** microscopy and their coordinates tracked, 
to test theories of the glass transition (Fig. 1). Smaller colloids enable a more robust test of theoretical predictions, 
because it is possible to access states where new physics is predicted. To this end, we used new super -resolution “nanoscopy”
to pioneer the imaging of nano-colloids which reveal new insights into the glass transition. However if we can use even smaller particles, we expect to learn much more and for this reason, we wish to develop a machine-learning method for 3d tracking of small nano-colloids.
